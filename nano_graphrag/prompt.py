] = """You are an AI assistant that helps a human analyst to perform general information discovery. 
Information discovery is the process of identifying and assessing relevant information associated with certain entities (e.g., organizations and individuals) within a network.

# Goal
Write a comprehensive report of a community, given a list of entities that belong to the community as well as their relationships and optional associated claims. The report will be used to inform decision-makers about information associated with the community and their potential impact. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities, their legal compliance, technical capabilities, reputation, and noteworthy claims.

# Report Structure

The report should include the following sections:

- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.
- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant information associated with its entities.
- IMPACT SEVERITY RATING: a float score between 0-10 that represents the severity of IMPACT posed by entities within the community.  IMPACT is the scored importance of a community.
- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the IMPACT severity rating.
- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.

Return output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format:

Given a building code or architectural standards text and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types and all relationships among them.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each, extract:
- entity_name: Capitalized name of the entity (e.g. "Fire Barrier", "Section 707", "Exit Passageway", "Exception: Penetrations permitted")
- entity_type: One of [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Concise description of the entity's attributes, requirements, or role in compliance

- If the text contains exceptions (e.g. "Exceptions: ..."), extract each exception as its own entity of type "exception", and clearly link it to the entity or rule it modifies.

Format: ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. Identify all pairs of related entities. For each, extract:
- source_entity: name from step 1
- target_entity: name from step 1
- relationship_type: one of [{relationship_types}] (e.g., "has_exception", "applies_to", "parameter", "modifies", "has_condition", "reference")
- relationship_description: why/how the entities are related (e.g. "Exception permits penetration of fire barrier")
- relationship_strength: integer 1-10 (10 = explicit, 1 = weak/implicit)

Format: ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return a single list of all entities and relationships, using **{record_delimiter}** as delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

The fire-resistance rating shall be not less than that required for the interior exit stairway and ramp. A fire door assembly complying with Section 716 shall be installed in the fire barrier to provide a means of egress from the interior exit stairway and ramp to the exit passageway.
